  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>
    This demo app is built purely for learning and showcasing purposes. It’s not a real
    service, so please don’t rely on it for anything important. Feel free to explore and
    have fun!
  </p>

  <h2>How to use:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To use the app you must create a dummy account.</li>
    <li>Do not use real information; enter made-up data only.</li>
    <li>Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.</li>
    <li>
      Stripe runs in sandbox mode. Use 4242 4242 4242 4242 as the card number and dummy
      details for the rest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Nodemailer was used only during local development and is removed in the deployed
      version. The password-reset flow still works, but it links directly to the reset page
      instead of sending an email.
    </li>
    <li>
      Image uploads are stored on the file system with Multer and are automatically removed
      when the server sleeps.
    </li>
  </ul>
