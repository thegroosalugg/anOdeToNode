  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I’m a full-stack developer based in Berlin. This project is built around a session‑driven request pipeline that
    keeps the app stateful across page loads. Form submissions persist their input, validation errors return cleanly
    without losing user data, and file uploads move through a temporary staging area until the form is actually valid.
    Anything abandoned gets cleaned up automatically. The session middleware coordinates all of this on every request:
    merging errors and form data into res.locals, resetting state when the user leaves a data‑handling route, and
    exposing the authenticated user to both controllers and templates. The client side is pure EJS, but structured
    around small reusable components that generate dynamic markup for multiple flows without duplication. The result is
    an SSR app that behaves like a small SPA without any client‑side framework.
